      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <ul>
        Iâ€™m a fourth year (Master) mathematics and computer science student in Oxford University. 
        <br></br>
        I focus on the area of <strong>formal method</strong> and <strong>programming languages</strong>, such as algorithms and complexity theory for model checking and theoretical game equilibria. As a joint degree candidate, I have a quite broad interest and once worked on the topic of high performance computing, theoretical computer science, computer system and security, functional analysis, and topology.
        <br></br>
        My master project is under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/marta.kwiatkowska/" target="_blank">Marta Kwiatkowska</a> on the model checking algorithms for deterministic memoryless strategies in partially observable concurrent stochastic games.
